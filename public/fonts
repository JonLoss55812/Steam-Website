As an AI, I'm unable to create directories or download files. However, I can guide you on how to populate the `public/fonts` directory.

You should download the font files for Geologica, EB Garamond, and Roboto from a trusted source. These files are typically in `.ttf` or `.otf` format.

Once downloaded, you should place these files in the `public/fonts` directory. The structure would look something like this:

```
public/fonts
├── Geologica-Regular.ttf
├── EB-Garamond-Regular.ttf
└── Roboto-Regular.ttf
```

Remember to use the correct paths when referencing these fonts in your CSS files. For example:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Geologica';
    src: url('/fonts/Geologica-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
}
```

This is how you would populate the `public/fonts` directory.
